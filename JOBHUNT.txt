Instruction to simulate the project:
To implement our project we have used SQL Server Management Studio (version 2014) & Microsoft Visual Studio (version 2019).
After downloading the whole project, the database model have to be executed. At first, the sql queries of entities must be created.
In the sql server management studio, the login is in Windows authentication mode. After connecting, the sql file 'JobHunt.sql' inside the 'Job Hunt' folder, 
queries for database creating needs to be executed first and then the queries for entity creating will be executed which are given in the sql file properly. 
So, it wonâ€™t be any problem to create the entities for the project.
After downloading the whole project there will be an JobHunt.sln file inside the JobHunt folder, which is the solution file for visual studio. 
After opening the file, the visual studio will be on and then the database according to the different servers is needed to be updated. For that, the Web.config file 
needs to be opened and inside the <connectionStrings> tag, the server name has to be changed as particular database servers. There will be written 
connectionString="Data Source=DESKTOP-FAQ6T3B\SQLEXPRESS, and in the place of DESKTOP-FAQ6T3B\SQLEXPRESS, the database server name has to be written where the queries
are execured. After that the project is ready to go on simulation.
